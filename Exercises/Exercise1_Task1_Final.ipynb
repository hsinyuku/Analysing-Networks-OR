    "# Task description\n",
    "The company **LGLog** is active in forest and wood management, transporting logs from the forest to sawmills. The company operates in multiple forests and owns several sawmills. The forest can only be reached by very expensive and specialized forest transporters with high fuel consumption. Therefore, the company wants to build transshipment hubs near the harvested forest areas to move the logs to cheaper and more fuel efficient trucks that will transport the logs to the sawmills. The company has identified several potential transshipment hubs. Your job is to decide which preselected locations should be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each transshipment hub has a fixed cost for being open. Vehicles have\n",
    "travel costs depending on the amount of logs they are carrying, which are arc dependent. Each type of vehicle has a capacity on the number of logs it can carry. Assume that the truck can handle more logs than a forest transporter. Additionally there is a uniform handling cost per log at the hubs. You can assume there are enough vehicles of both types available to carry all of the demand, but multiple vehicles of the same type may not travel on the same arc at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you are aware of the demand at each sawmill and the supply\n",
    "in terms of logs at each forest. Note that these two quantities need not be balanced. LGLog is paid a fixed price per log delivered to any sawmill. Every hub can be reached from any forest and every sawmill can be reached from any hub with different distances in between them. It is also possible to travel directly from the forst to a sawmill. Transporting logs between hubs is prohibited. Furthermore, no logs are transported between sawmills nor between forest areas."
