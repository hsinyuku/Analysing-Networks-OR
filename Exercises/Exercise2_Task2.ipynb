    "1. There is never an explicit calculation of $f(i, j)$ for any pair of nodes.\n",
    "2. Logical implementation of comparing arrival with departure and parking time windows is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "In further explanation, we use the following terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The end node (in code: `endNode`) is the last node of the path whose possible extensions we currently check.\n",
    "- The next node (in code: `nextNode`) is one potential extension node of the same path.\n",
    "- The previous node (`previousNode`) is the node in the current path before the end node.\n",
    "- Arrival time (accessed in code by `pathInfo[\"arrival\"][node]`) is the actual arrival time at a node, *given its current parking times at all previous nodes*. Most importantly, this is *not* the *earliest feasible arrival time* as described in Sancho (1992).\n",
    "- The current path (`pathInfo`) is always the paths whose extensions we currently evaluate.\n",
    "- The departure and parking time windows of a node $i$ (to node $j$) can be defined as $[\\gamma_{ij}, \\delta_{ij}]$ and $[\\alpha_i, \\beta_i]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pathInfo` (see example above) always must contain a path as a list, actual parking times at each node other than the end node, and arrival times at each node (including the end node). The function first starts a for-loop over all possible extensions to the end node (if the current end node is 7, then the path is directly copied to P). For every next node, a copy is made of the current path to the object `currentPath`. Following this, the feasibility check is performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check whether arrival at current end node occurs after the departure time window to the next node closes. This corresponds to equation (5) in Sancho (1992). In this case, the next iteration of the for-loop begins, meaning that the current extension is discarded.\n",
    "2. Check whether arrival at end node is in departure time window to next node. This corresponds to equation (4) in Sancho (1992); note that we did not check for $\\alpha_i$, because regardles of its value, parking under this condition is 0 and the extension is feasible. The arrival time at the next node can thus be calculated by adding arrival time at the end node and travel time from there to the next node.\n",
    "3. Check whether arrival at end node occurs in parking time window and parking time window overlaps with departure time window. This corresponds to equation (1) in Sancho (1992) (slightly altered). In this case, actual parking is set to end when the departure time window opens, and arrival at the next node is the end of the actual parking time at the end node, plus travel time to the next node.\n",
    "4. Check whether the arrival time is too early. This should always be the case, except when arrival occurs in the parking time window, but parking time window and departure time window don't overlap. The algorithm calculates the necessary delay of arrival at the end node (`tooEarly`), and sets parking at the end node to 0. Then it jumps to the previous node. There it determines a the new parking period, which starts witht the arrival at the previous node, but ends at the earliest of end of departure time to the end node, end of waiting time window, or necessary delay of arrival time at end node. This way, the algorithm makes sure that parking time is within allowed boundaries and not larger than necessary.\n",
    "After having changed parking time at the previous node, the algorithm jumps back to the end node and calculates the new arrival time there. Now, the conditions 2. and 3. from above are implemented and the path is changed accordingly. Note that condition 1. does not need to be checked again; this is ensured by calculation of the end of the new parking period at the previous node. "

    "## Shortcomings\n",
    "Currently, there are two main problems with the algorithm provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing domination criteria\n",
    "We have not implemented a domination criterium because of our understanding of the criteria derived by Sancho (1992). Using equation (6), the algorithm should set the earliest arrival time $f(j,k)$ to is minimal value for all nodes $i$ preceding $j$. This leads to a potential problem: there might be cases where later actual arrival times at $k$ fall in the departure time window to some node $l$, whereas earlier actual arrival times might fall outside both the departure time window to $l$ and waiting time at $k$. However, a path via $l$ may eventually be faster than another route. This is the reason that we think that equation (6) is ultimately not suitable to find fastest paths.\n",
    "For the same reasons, we discarded equation (10) as a dominance criterium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both criteria could still be implemented. To do this, we could add a new object that stores minimal feasible arrival times for a pair of nodes (i,j). These can then be compared to actual arrival time at every step of the while-loop, and paths with subopotimal arrival times can be discarded from U and P. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Shallow \"backpropagation\" for too early arrival times\n",
    "If the algorithm encounters too early arrival time and condition 4. from above is fulfilled, it checks whether parking at the previous node can be delayed. In this example, this \"shallow backpropagation\" is sufficient to find the optimal path. In other cases, it might be necessary to go back further along the path to determine whether parking can be increased in any of the other preceding nodes. This could be implemented recursively; however, this in turn requires some of the conditions to be implemented as functions. "
