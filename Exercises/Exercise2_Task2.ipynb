    "\n",
    "- The end node (in code: `endNode`) is the last node of the path whose possible extensions we currently check.\n",
    "- The next node (in code: `nextNode`) is one potential extension node of the same path.\n",
    "- Arrival time (accessed in code by `pathInfo[\"arrival\"][node]`) is the actual arrival time at a node, *given its current parking times at all previous nodes*. Most importantly, this is *not* the *earliest feasible arrival time* as described in Sancho (1992).\n",

    "`pathInfo` (see example above) always must contain a path as a list, actual parking times at each node other than the end node, and arrival times at each node (including the end node). The function first starts a for-loop over all possible extensions to the end node (if the current end node is 7, then the path is directly copied to P). For every next node, a copy is made of the current path to the object `currentPath`. Following this, the feasibility check is performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check whether arrival at current end node occurs after the departure time window to the next node closes. This corresponds to equation (5) in Sancho (1992). In this case, the next iteration of the for-loop begins, meaning that the current extension is discarded.\n",
    "2. Check whether arrival at end node is in departure time window to next node. This corresponds to equation (4) in Sancho (1992); note that we did not check for $\\alpha_i$, because regardles of its value, parking under this condition is 0 and the extension is feasible. The arrival time at the next node can thus be calculated by adding arrival time at the end node and travel time from there to the next node.\n",
    "3. Check whether arrival at end node occurs in parking time window and parking time window overlaps with departure time window. This corresponds to equation (1) in Sancho (1992) (slightly altered). In this case, actual parking is set to end when the departure time window opens, and arrival at the next node is the end of the actual parking time at the end node, plus travel time to the next node."

    "### Missing domination criteria\n",
    "We have not implemented a domination criterium because of our understanding of the criteria derived by Sancho (1992). Using equation (6), the algorithm should set the earliest arrival time $f(j,k)$ to is minimal value for all nodes $i$ preceding $j$. This leads to a potential problem: there might be cases where later actual arrival times at $k$ fall in the departure time window to some node $l$, whereas earlier actual arrival times might fall outside both the departure time window to $l$ and waiting time at $k$. However, a route via $l$ may eventually be faster than another route. This is the reason that we think that equation (6) is ultimately not suitable to find fasest routes.\n",
