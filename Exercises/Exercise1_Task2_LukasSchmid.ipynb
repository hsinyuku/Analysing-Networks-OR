    "# Task description\n",
    "The following is based on problem 12.23 from “Model Building in Mathematical Programming, Fourth Edition” by H. Paul Williams (John Wiley & Sons, 2002). A small milk processing company is committed to **collecting milk from 20 farms and taking it back to the depot for processing**. The company has **one tanker truck with a capacity for carrying 80 000 liters** of milk. **Some of the farms are small and need a collection only every other day**. The **other farms need a collection every day**. The **route of the truck starts and ends at a depot**, and **it is possible to travel between all nodes**. The goal is to find the optimal route for the tanker truck on each day, bearing in mind that it has to:\n",

    "3. Work within its capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "On alternate days it must again visit the ‘every day’ farms, but also visit the ‘every other day’ farms not visited on the previous day."
